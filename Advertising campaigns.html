        <h3> My hobbies(in a poem way💯🧑‍🎨): </h3>
        <p>        
        In the rhythm of life, a runner takes the stage, 
        Through winding paths, in every life's page. <br> 
        Footfalls echo, a heartbeat's thrive, 
        In the pulse of each step, you feel alive. <br>

        On the football field, a symphony unfolds, 
        Passion and skill, in stories untold. <br>
        The dance of a ball, a goal in sight, 
        A celebration of strength, in the twilight. <br>

        Languages flow like a river's embrace, 
        Words become bridges to another space. <br>
        Conversations in hues, vibrant and clear, 
        A polyglot's world, drawing friends near. <br>

        In the realm of sweat, in exercises bold, 
        Muscles flex, a tale of strength told. <br>
        A canvas of movements, a sculptor's delight, 
        Physical prowess, in the day's soft light. <br>

        Projects unfold, like petals unfurl, 
        A symphony of progress, a dance of swirl. <br>
        In the realm of creation, ideas come alive, 
        A visionary's journey, where dreams thrive. <br>

        Yet amidst skills diverse, a goal stands tall, 
        To feel alive, the heart's eternal call. <br>
        In the tapestry of passions, a vibrant hive, 
        You chase the essence of what makes you alive. <br>

        <h3>Do physical exercises:🏋️‍♂️🎬</h3>
        <p>
            I've started going to the gym about 1 year and a half. 
            Some people ask me but "That's why?"<br>
            I want to get more muscles and weight but You know what?
            I am ectomorph so I have to focus in my training and I am!<br>
            By the way I've been stopped to run what is my paisson 
            I am thinking to back but I'll have to eat more and more<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Another hobby: Talk in another languages🗣️💭 </h3>
        <p>
           As you might know reading about me I speak more than 2 languages that's because I love to talk!
           I speak Portuguese language as my native language, <br> English language and Spanish language. 
           I'm also so curious about French and Japanese language, You'll see my friend from Czech Republic 
           down,<br> We talk in English I've meet her 5 years ago and We keep talking, I love to speak English! <br>
