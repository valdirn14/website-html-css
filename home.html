            ABOUT VALDIR
        </h1></b>

        <h2>Hello, my name is Valdir üëã</h1>

         <p>My name is Valdir, I started programming through the encouragement of my brother who is a programmer, 
         so I started studying at Unopar University (higher course, 2 years), during the course I also started 
         at another institution called Prepara Cursos. There I started a course in the bootcamp format where 
         I studied Web Development linked to Html and Css technologies.
         </p>

         <p>It was a great effort that I loved experiencing! üòÑ
         <br />How my knowledge became lives, actions became realities, I was very enchanted. With my creative and 
         revolutionary potential I want to add to this direction of technology!
         </p>

         <p>Having knowledge in various areas and with various backgrounds, I fall head over heels in this new area of 
         ‚Äã‚Äãtechnology, currently studying at DIO, Udemy, as well as studying a Technical Course in Administration, I 
         hope to have different experiences as a web developer
         </p>

        <h2> It's me again, Now I'll say about my personality: in a poem wayüíØüßë‚Äçüé® </h2>

         <p>
            In the heart of Brazil, where dreams take flight, <br>
            A scholar's journey, bathed in the softest light. <br>
            Studying through the years, a fervent belief, <br>
            Yet job opportunities remain a distant reef.<br>
            <br>
            A dreamer, you stand, with aspirations high, <br>
            Practicing Spanish and English, reaching the sky. <br>
            Friends from distant lands, their stories unfold, <br>
            In the tapestry of languages, connections are bold. <br>
            <br>
            A global spirit, yearning to explore, <br>
            To travel the world, to distant shores. <br>
            A symphony of cultures, a dance so grand, <br>
            In every step, you'd find your own strand. <br>
            <br>
            Remote work, a vision that gleams so bright,<br>
            A dream to chase, in the soft moonlight.<br>
            A fusion of learning, of work, and delight,<br>
            In the canvas of life, paint your dream in the night. <br>
            <br>
            Study and toil, let your ambitions bloom, <br>
            For dreams are the seeds, in life's vast room. <br>
            May the pages of your efforts turn into art, <br>
            A masterpiece of success, a work of the heart. <br>
            <br>

            <h5>Meaning: <br>

             travel for some countries in the world and feel alive, I have work and keep studying but show for myself <br>
