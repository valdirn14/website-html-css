        <p>
            Gray whale
            Now that we are sending you to The End
            That great god
            Tell him 
            That we who follow you invented forgiveness
            And forgive nothing

            I write as though you could understand
            And I could say it
            One must always pretend something
            Among the dying
            When you have left...
        </p>

        <p>
            Sonnet of Fidelity (Vinicius de Moraes)
            Of everything, I will be attentive to my love
            Before, and with such zeal, and always, and so much
            That even in the face of the greatest charm
            My thoughts are more enchanted by him. I want to live him in every vain moment
            And in praise I will spread my song
            And laugh my laugh and shed my tears
            To your regret or your joy. And so, when you look for me later
            Who knows death, anguish of those who live
            Who knows the loneliness, the end of those who love? I can tell me about the love (that I had):
            That it is not immortal, since it is flame
            But let it be infinite while it lasts.
        </p>
